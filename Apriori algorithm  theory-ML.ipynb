    "# Apriori Algorithm?\n",
    "   Apriori Algorithm is a frequent pattern mining algorithm that is used in association rule learning. It is wiely used in market basket\n",
    "   analysis to find associations and relationships between items in large datasets of transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "How Apriori Algorithm works?\n",
    "1. It identify all frequent individual items in a dataset.\n",
    "2. Then it extend them to larger item sets as long as those item sets appear frequently enough in the data.\n",
    "3. Then it use the frequent item sets to generate association rules."
